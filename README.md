Getting ready to deploy on a DO droplet. Printed instructions. I've not been coding as much as reviewing and putting off this process. But I've done it before...just because it wasn't easy, I did do it. And I'm sure it will actually be much easier because I have a clue about what I am doing. But PTSD hurts. Let's crush it tomorrow. Plus there's nothing I can't undo.
